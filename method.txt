** we are going to have some couples of images of programming languages 
** the rules are so simple , you just have to guess the couples and the game finishes when you guess them all




==================== Programming method ================



** every card will have : 
                    - id (needed in jsx for iteration)
                    -image name 
                    -actual image 
                    -isDone (to keep the done cards flipped)
                    -isWaiting (to toggle the className and flip the card) 

++ states and variables : 
                    - data : it hold all the informations of the cards
                    - flippedImg : the name of the current flipped image
                    - times : it is the number of times the player flipes an image it can be 0 or 1 or 2
                        and it turns to 0 everytime the player guesses 
                     

** story of the algorithm (how it works)
- the player clicks on a first card 
        -> passing the id and the name of the clicked card
        -> time++ ==> times = 1
        -> flipedImg = name of fliped card
        -> data[id].isWaiting = true ===> toggling className to flip the card

- the player clicks on the second card 
        -> passing the id and the name of the clicked card
        -> times++ ==> times = 2
        -> conditions : 
                - if (data[id].imageName === flippedImg) => - every data[id].imageName === flipedImg => isDone=true
                                                            - times=0
                                                            - flipedImg=''

                - else =>   - times=0
                            - flipedImg = ''
                            - for every card => isWaiting = false
